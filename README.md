## Introduction

## Setup

## Tailwind CSS Configuration
#I setup Dark Mode & Themes for containers, padding, sizing etc, and extended certain UI components like border-radius, keyframes and animmations to keep the visuals consistent throughout the App.

## Getting Started
#The Icon library being used is Lucide-React which is a light weight library
#For Themes and UI Components I decided to go with ShadCN-UI. Which is a very seamless easy UI platform.

#I chose to use Kinde-oss for my auth as this seamlessly integrates into nextjs
